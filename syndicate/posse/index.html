High school and the hostel days, I had so little time with them. But 2023 changed that for me. I got to stay at home and focus on myself. We have a shop near the school, and I spend the whole day there, talking with different people. It's such a joy to play cricket with the little kids who come by, and my brother and I have so much fun together.<p>I remember the days when my brother, a few others, and I used to go for early morning runs, navigating through the fog with just the light of our mobile torches. We would spend the rest of the day playing with the goats.<p>While enjoying with my parents, I've done a lot of open source work, especially <code>rust</code>. I've written <a href=https://github.com/pwnwriter/haylxon><code>haylxon</code></a>, <a href=https://github.com/pwnwriter/hysp><code>hysp</code></a> and explored a lot about the Rust's core and internals. As previous year, This year as well, i've attended <a href=https://threatcon.io><code>Threatcon</code></a>. It was soo much fun ;o;.<p>Yes and bye!</div></article><article class=syndicate><h2><a href=https://pwnwriter.me/syndications/posse-2022/>The 2022</a></h2><p class="subtitle --center"><code>2023-01-30</code><div class=syndicate-text><p>My 2022 was an extraordinary year for me. I launched <a href=https://github.com/metis-os><code>METISLinux</code></a>, a project I'm proud of, reflecting my dedication. I also met a diverse group of individuals at <a href=https://threatcon.io><code>Threatcon</code></a>, gaining valuable connections and insights.<p>Academically, I completed my +2 in major science with excellent grades. I received recognition from the Dutch government and a letter of appreciation from Cambridge University for my bug reports. I also earned the eJPT certification and started learning Rust.<p>Reuniting with old online friends in person was a highlight, contributing to my personal and professional growth.<p>Overall, 2022 was a year of progress and achievements. I'm excited for the future. See you next year!<p>Ba-bye!</div></article></div><div class=hidden><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/pwnwriter rel=me>Linkedin</a></div><div class="hidden h-card"><img class="u-photo icon" alt=pwnwriter src=/res/thumbnail.png><a class="p-name u-url" href=https://pwnwriter.me>pwnwriter</a><p class=p-note>I make and break softwares professionally</div><footer><p class=codewithlove>This website does not collect your data.<span class=main-background>No languages models</span>were involved in writing the content here except where explicitly noted.<p class=footer-links><a href=/atom.xml>RSS</a> | <a href=https://github.com/pwnwriter.gpg>pgp::signature</a> | <a href=https://github.com/pwnwriter/wood target=_blank>Source Code</a></footer><ol id=themeSelector reversed></ol><script defer src=/assets/js/linkSelector.js></script><ol id=linkSelector></ol>
