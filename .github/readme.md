### About

Over the years, I've redesigned my website many times. Whenever I see something new that catches my eye, I want to incorporate it into my site. This time, I'd like to use `zola`.

### Tips 

-   On [`NIX`][Nix] , run `nix develop` to enter a shell with all `deps`.
  
  ```bash
$ zola serve # serves the site
$ zola build # builds the site
  ```
-   Run `Nix develop .#lychee` to check for broken links
