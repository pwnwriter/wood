Moving from Nepal to the USA has been one of the biggest changes in my life.The
moment I landed, everything felt new and different. From the busy streets to
the new school, I’m starting a fresh chapter in a new country. 


## Background
After finishing high school, I made the decision to pursue my
bachelor’s degree in the US. My visa interview on April 25 went well, and I was
really excited to receive the approval. In the time leading up to my departure, I
cherished moments of relaxation with my office friends and family.

When the day finally arrived on August 19, I was overwhelmed with a mix of
emotions. As I prepared to board the flight, my parents were there, tearfully
saying their goodbyes. I found myself in tears as well, feeling a mix of
nervousness and sadness. It was my first flight, and the idea of leaving my
parents and starting a new chapter in a foreign land felt both exhilarating and
daunting. The thought of facing this journey without their immediate support
was intimidating, and the prospect of finding my own way was both exciting and
bit scary.

## The flight
The flight was quite smooth overall. After the five hours journey from Nepal, I had a
transit in Doha, where I was amazed by the size of the airport—it's enormous,
and it's easy to get lost if you’re not careful. During the flight, I made a
great new friend, which made the trip even more enjoyable.

However, I had a bit of a hiccup with security. After the flight, I went
through a security check with my carry-on bag, which contained just my laptop
and a few essentials. I’m not sure if there was something specific they were
concerned about, but I ended up having to go through the security check twice.
Being alone and a little nervous, it was a bit unsettling, but I managed to
handle it with a bit of humor.

## The City

The flight from Doha to Miami was fantastic. The pictures and lights of Doha
are still vivid in my mind—they were absolutely stunning. 

I finally landed in Miami around 11 o’clock morning after clearing immigration.
The weather is really pleasant. The city itself is a lot of fun, especially if
you enjoy its vibrant atmosphere.

## The Next Move
My college friends are here with me, but I really miss my parents back home. I
also miss the weather, culture, and everyday life in Nepal. My next step is to
become stronger and more adaptable, so I can handle whatever comes my way and
fit in better in my new environment.

See you around!
