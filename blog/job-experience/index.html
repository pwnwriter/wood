After high school, I was at home with my parents, doing errands and
self-learning while preparing for my USA visa interview. Out of the blue, a
well-known company reached out with a job offer. Despite not getting the terms
I hoped for, I decided to take the opportunity.
The job
There wasn't anything specifically like working on just one domain. I used to
manage linux server's, providing technical support and so on.
what i got..?


The best boys:
Itâ€™s probably impossible to find teammates who are both incredibly helpful and equally supportive and encouraging at the same time.
Gotta miss them ðŸ«¡





A new opportunity :
I was able to introduce nix across my teammates, Not
just that but 3 of our production servers now use nix as a user level and
core level. 
It was an absolutely fantastic opportunity for me to learn
and apply Nix on servers according to user requirements, rather than just
for personal projects. 
I believe that working to fulfill otherâ€™s needs teaches you more than
working on personal projects alone.


The Experience :
While Iâ€™m a bit sad this is ending, we had an amazing time exploring different
places. My first week alone was filled with tours and adventures. The office
environment was incredibly friendly and helpful, which made the experience even
better.



    
    

Moving on ...
I've my USA flight soon within a very few weeks. I took resign from the job
but i miss the boys i met there. They were absolute amazing people. I wish to
work with them later and forever.
