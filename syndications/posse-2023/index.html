High school and the
hostel days, I had so little time with them. But 2023 changed that for me. I
got to stay at home and focus on myself. We have a shop near the school, and I
spend the whole day there, talking with different people. It's such a joy to
play cricket with the little kids who come by, and my brother and I have so
much fun together.
I remember the days when my brother, a few others, and I used to go for early
morning runs, navigating through the fog with just the light of our mobile
torches. We would spend the rest of the day playing with the goats.
While enjoying with my parents, I've done a lot of open source work, especially
rust. I've written haylxon, hysp and explored a lot
about the Rust's core and internals. As previous year, This year as well, i've
attended Threatcon. It was soo much fun ;o;.
Yes and bye!
