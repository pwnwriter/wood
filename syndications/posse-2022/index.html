I launched METISLinux, a project I'm
proud of, reflecting my dedication. I also met a diverse group of individuals
at Threatcon, gaining valuable connections and insights.
Academically, I completed my +2 in major science with excellent grades. I
received recognition from the Dutch government and a letter of appreciation
from Cambridge University for my bug reports. I also earned the eJPT
certification and started learning Rust.
Reuniting with old online friends in person was a highlight, contributing to my
personal and professional growth.
Overall, 2022 was a year of progress and achievements. I'm excited for the
future. See you next year!
Ba-bye!
